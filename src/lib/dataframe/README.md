# Dataframe

This module contains the main data structure for Projects, the _data frame_.

A data frame contains _data records_ and _data fields_. You can think of records as the rows in a table, and fields as the columns. The example below shows a data frame with four records, and three fields (`due_date`, `published`, and `hours_spent`).

| `id`                 | `due_date` | `published` | `hours_spent` |
