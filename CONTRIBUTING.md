# Contribute to Projects

Thank you for considering contributing to Projects! On this page, you'll learn how you can help make Projects even better!

## Voting for features

Since the release of Projects, users have requested more features than we have resources to implement. Your voice matters, and we need your help understand what's most important.

Help prioritize work by adding a :+1: reaction to issues that are important to you ([see the most requested issues](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-projects/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc)).

To see what's being working on, check out the [roadmap](https://github.com/users/marcusolsson/projects/4/views/14).


## Submitting a pull request

You can work on any issue with the `lifecycle/backlog` label. Before you start working, please announce that you want to do so by commenting on the issue. I'll add the `lifecycle/active` label to let others know that it's being actively worked on by someone.

## Triaging issues

You can contribute by helping an issue move forward. Depending on the labels on the issue, you can help in different ways:

- Vote for issues that are important to you.
- Help figuring out how to reproduce bugs.
- Provide support for ideas by sharing your use case.
- Find issues that are duplicates of already existing issues.

## Understanding labels

Projects uses labels for issues to organize work. This section lists all the labels used by the project and what they mean.

### Kind

`kind/*` describes the type of issue. All issues **must** have a `kind/*` label.

| Label | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `kind/bug` | Something isn't working. |
| `kind/feature` | New feature request. |
| `kind/documentation` | Improvements or additions to documentation. |
| `kind/cleanup` | Cleaning up code, configuration, or technical debt. |
| `kind/epic` | Issues that contain other issues and design discussions for big changes. |
| `kind/support` | (Deprecated) Use [Discussions](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-projects/discussions/categories/help) for support questions. |

### Triage

When a user creates an issue, it needs to be reviewed, or _triaged_, to be able to label it correctly.

`triage/*` describes the triage status for an issue.

| ----- | ----------- |
| `triage/confirmed` | Issue is well-defined and understood. Needs to have a `priority/*` label. |
| `triage/duplicate` | Issue is a duplicate of another issue. |

| `triage/needs-investigation` | Issue needs investigation before it can be confirmed. |

| Label | Description |

| `lifecycle/frozen` | Frozen issues can't become stale or rotten. |

### Priority

| Label | Description |
